Java implementation of [Petrovich](http://dangermouse.net/esoteric/petrovich.html): operant conditioning in command systems

Operant Conditioning comes to command systems!
This is a java implementation of DangerMouse's Petrovich operating system description.
Just a simple project that I thought would be fun to try.
